    <p class="card-text">New education policy 2020! <br>
<br>
    Education has moreover been the most important national activity,to be precise it can be called as the backbone to our country's
     progress. <br>
     Over the years it has produced so many genius minds that make our country proud all over the world. <br>
     Till today, the main criteria regarding education and it's policies has been quite rigid. We have been following 
     the same norms over years and years.. wherein we see the disparities between subjects more weightage given to a specific 
     stream, the ongoing pressure to choose a particular stream by parents or to look smarter than others. These are all the
      things we have been following since ages. <br>
      As a developing country there have been changes in our country for the better but the education system had been the same. <br>
      Personally speaking I am in the favour of the <strong> new education policy </strong> <br>

It is the context that our education sector needs to gear itself towards the demands of the 21st century. <br>

Keeping it as a priority where Quality, innovation and research will be the pillars on which our country will become a knowledge 
super power. <br>

There has been a tremendous reform as of the new education policy is concerned. It has vividly removed all the barriers that only added to the complexities on the education system and many a times acted as a demotivater on the students minds as well.
<br>
The government declares that there will be no rigid seperation between arts and science stream which is by far the best thing to know. It will no longer follow the multi disciplinary approach giving the students it's democratic rights to pursue their own creative minds the way they like. 
<br>
If a student wants to learn fashion designing with physics, or if a student wants to learn bakery with chemistry, they'll be allowed to do so.
<br>
It is great to know that we as students can choose two contrasting career options in one.
<br>
It is a great start to the coming changes which will inhabit in our coming years. The classes which would be more theoretical will be more practical with the emergence of this new policy, the minds will no more be only revolving around books but let the student exhibit the virtual ideas around him and get he's/her visualised creation to reality.
<br>
To conclude, I would add up by saying slowly and steadily we have broken the old streotypes of many things that were happening around us, with the emergence of the new education policy we will be able to eradicate the typical mindsets of many people about the education system.
<br>
Also as a student acknowledging and thanking the government for giving us the opportunity to explore our ideas and creativity in a more innovative way.
<br>

<br>
Oh my god!, She got the "perfect body", she's so slim and look at me! I have put on so much of weight! These chubby cheeks, love handles and this BIG STOMACH which always pops out!! <br>
Ahh why me lord? Look at her she's so perfect! Why can't I be like her? Why can't I have that body? <br>
Haven't we all come across this phase once in our lives when we see these perfect bodies around us.. especially models and actresses flaunting their "size zero".??
 <br> Teenage is one of the most stressful times in a person's life. This is the time when we begin to discover ourselves, want to be more independent, desperately need the peer acceptance and start developing an attitude towards our own personality.
 <br> Yes! We live in a society where figures and beauties are highly valued,Tv commercials are all about how to be fit and fine!
<br> The Reel world showcasing us that how important it is to a woman to have that ideal body to please the World.
 <br> The media contributes in a great way to poor body image
 <br> The "size zero" trend which was started by kareena Kapoor for a movie made every girl go crazy about her body. Although the movie didn't do that well a storm of buzz was created after Kareena Kapoor attained "size zero"!
<br> Every girl or body wants to be in shape.Nowadays we see that the gyms are full of young boys and girls pumping iron and working on the trademill, protein supplements are flying off the shelf.
<br> Now, let's talk about "size zero" what does it actually mean? It refers to extremely thin individuals (especially women and young adolescent girls) but who knows about the negative impacts of all these mindless starvation and exercises.
<br> They adopt unhealthy eating patterns that can really affect their health in long run.
<br> Whenever we think about a beautiful girl it always includes her being thin! They say "beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder"
<br> Why can't a little plump girl be beautiful? Why aren't Chubby cheeks better than those sharp jawlines? Why isn't a healthier body preferred over a thin body?
<br> Watching beautiful women and handsome men who have the perfect bodies on television, is a big incentive for a majority of us to loose weight and get that desired body. But, off screen health problems such as anorexia,bulimia and other related ailments are all hidden from us.
<br> To be honest, what is life without food? You only end up being ill tempered when you starve yourself.
<br> It is a good thing to look upto someone and become like them if it benifits you but if it has negative impacts on you why are you doing it?
<br> Why do we always need somebody else's validation on our body? 
<br> Why do we get so sad when we hear somebody say anything negative to us, may it be about the way we look or if you're slightly on a healthier side!? Why is there always a competition to look better than somebody else and to fit in that "little black dress"?
<br> Why do you need to please others to accept you the way you are? 
<br> Why is it getting so important for us, to fit in the "size zero" race and avoid eating our favourite food?
<br> In real life barely do we give any importance to the number "0" then why have we given that number "0" so much importance in our physical appearance?
<br> Have you ever thought about this?
<br> All I would like to say is, We all look upto somebody or the other. May it be an actor, a friend, an influencer or any random person whom you  don't know. It is normal and absolutely fine to adore somebody else, but in all that don't forget who you are! you don't have to change yourself for anybody else!
<br> To every girl out there who feels that her body is not fitting into whatever criteria. STOP GETTING SAD ABOUT IT!
<br> The obsession with "size zero" is dangerous. it sends people to depression,health problems and even death attimes.
Physical fitness is healthy, Exercise and eat nutritious food cutting on all the junk to avoid weight. But getting severely obsessed with weight loss can play major havoc with your mental and physical health!
Eat whatever you like, wear whatever you wish to. Don't get into the race of attaining size zero because it really doesn't matter also don't let anybody tell you how you should look or be.
<br> Love life,Live Life!
<br> Be happy. Remain healthy!

<br>  "Of all  the hard jobs around one of the hardest is being a teacher"
   <br> A teacher is somebody who leaves a great impact on a student and over time we as students always tend to develop a liking towards a particular teacher for various reasons.
  <br>  To me, I have had two teachers whom I admire so much and call them my "favourite teachers"
  <br>  I have always wanted to attend their classes and not miss out on any.
  <br>  Firstly, let me start with my english teacher Mrs.Anisha Coutinho because of whom I developed a liking for English since the 6th grade. She was beautiful, gentle, soft spoken and truly Graceful in her way of teaching which not just me but everybody else admired. Her way of teaching was so effortless that I always wanted to learn more and never wanted the class to end. Since then, I have always wanted to present myself with the same confidence as she did and be able to talk just as fluently as her and I can very much say that she definitely plays a Major role in my life, it is because of her I developed so much interest in the subject and wanted to proceed in this particular field ahead.
   <br> Now, moving to a completely opposite subject "maths"!
   <br> As much as I love English equivalently I disliked maths( not an unusual thing for most of the students) but, something totally changed my perception towards dealing with the subject.
   <br> As we come to the 10th grade, every parent wants their child to go to the best Teacher for learning especially when it comes to a subject like maths and science.
   <br> Just like everybody, my parents admitted me to the very well known professor! 
   <br> At the beginning I was as usual disinterested and had a rough sketch about how the sir would be. Generally, when it comes to a maths or science teacher we do have an idea of how that teacher is going to be i.e, "VERY STRICT AND BORING" well, to my surprise it was not the same as I thought.
   <br> My Sir, Mr. Santosh Shetye had totally broken the typical stereotypes of being the "Strict/boring"Teacher teaching maths. 
   <br> An epitome of immense knowledge,great intelligence and a solid humour.
   <br> Yes,it was for real hes way of teaching automatically changed my perception towards the subject, not like I excelled brilliantly and scored a 80/80 but the disinterest, 0 span of attention in maths classes, waiting desperately for the class to get over, never understanding the value of "X" or just not being able to solve the simple equation was not the same anymore.
   <br> There was a drastic change towards my liking for that subject and all thanks to sir, it wasn't that usual boring class of maths but a class where every sum was taught with a trick which made it trillion times more fun to solve it ,A class full of laughter and fun.
   <br> Sir not just helped me in solving problems but taught me that a teacher can develop a liking towards even those subjects which you could never imagine liking, giving another reason to being firm in the career decision I made for myself. Whenever the class was bored he always cracked a joke (which was genuinely funny and students didn't laugh just for the sake of laughing) to distress us, he always gave us life lessons in the smallest way but never indulged in unwanted story telling.
   <br> It was not just the human side of him that makes him my favourite teacher, but how he was so incredible at he's subject, hardworking, punctual and explained every difficult topic in a lucid way.
   <br> All I can say is that he was the best and I couldn't have made it without he's guidance.
   <br> To the world a teacher will just be a teacher but to me they are the real hero's
  <br>  The hero's who shape our future.
   <br> All my teacher's have played a great role in my life but my favourite ones will always be a little more closer to my heart.
  <br>  I miss them so much, appreciating them in every way possible and Hoping to make them proud someday.

<br>
The world where we live is a lonely place. Pressurised by expectations,haunted by dreams, overpowered by weakness and drowned out by lofty goals.
<br>
In the midst of this we tend to forget ourselves.. We forget to "live"! 
<br>
Life's routines for humans revolve around work, studies, commitments which definitely keeps us grounded, but at the end we may be left feeling there is no room for anything else. When fun is put to motion, for most of us it is done with a modem of guilt and worry, Minds drifting in a river of thoughts.. "I haven't started studying for the upcoming exam!!", "What's happening at home? "Gotto prepare for the Monday Morning"!! "Did I pay the electricity bill"? "Should I check my phone for anything"?
<br>
IT IS SURVIVAL VS SAVOUR!
<br>
The essence of living is to live with 'duty and purpose'.
<br>
Truly speaking, it is the "little things" that bring joy and endless amounts of memories to your heart. 
<br>
It's not the money you make and the luxury you live, but the happiness you perceive, the positivity towards life, getting surrounded by positive people who only and only bring out the best in you, doing what you like and putting your 100% at it and achieving your best!
<br>
The things that are really worth having are the ones money 'CAN'T' buy!
<br>
What would be the price you would put on a sunset or a moonrise?
<br>
Do kisses and hugs feel less special because they are free?
<br>
How much would you pay for the smell of fresh rain on parched earth?
<br>
What amount of money will get those days back where you and your friends created loads of memories with laughter to cherish forever!
<br>
The mountains, would they be even more majestic,branded?
<br>
Will running down a sandy beach in a branded pair of shoes feel any better than barefoot?
<br>
On your worst days will you choose to call your bestfriend and cry or have an emotional talk with your credit card?
<br>
Is anything more voluptuous than the first mango of summer?
<br>
The first time you learnt to ride a bicycle,scored an A+ after studying really hard for a test and got a pat on your back by your parents.. the feeling you know you have made your parents proud for something which you can see fluttering in their eyes!
<br>
The oil massages you get from your grandmother and discuss the gossip of the world, the time you teach your grandfather how to operate a Nokia and he is amused by your skills of technology and you definitely become he's go-to mobile technician!
<br>
The first time you cook and the whole family applauds in joy where an ordinary chocolate cake would taste better than the finest pastry in the world.. how much more valuable is an old old friendship to a vintage wine?
<br>
The first movie you watched with your friends is by far your favourite one..
<br>
The shoutings and beatings you've gotten from your teachers THEN may seem the worst but, if you think of it now it only brings a smile and a hundred of memories back.
<br>
The first time you had a crush on somebody.. the teenage infatuation days are definitely treasured for life to laugh at as you grow older!
<br>
As said, the blind only wish to see, the deaf only wish to hear and the mute only wish to speak. Things that seem of just little value to us, can be all that someone wants!
<br>
And again I say, in the end it all sums up to the little things in life. Our priorities may seem different, but it all comes down to the basic 'human needs' i.e, we all desire a purpose, strive to be happy and need to be loved and create memories for life!
